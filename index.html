    <p>Over 17 years of professional experience in Graphic Design, exposed to most of the creative disciplines and information that a substantial designer must master. The knowledge that I have gained has prepared me to be a rigorous thinker, a good problem solver whose strong design skills are the most critical aspect of Visual Communications. The sum of my past work and education has prepared me for both the fast-paced and the creative environment that I believe is necessary for a successful career in graphic design.<br><a href="#">link here</a></a></p>
